## Codility Solutions
(https://codility.com/programmers/lessons)

This contains the python code for my submissions to Codility's lessons challenges.

Codility is a platform that allows companies to evaluate the programming skills of a coder, it analyzes the algorithm's performance through time and space complexity. It also hosts programming competitions every now and then.

Notes:
 - The solutions for each lessons are stored to its corresponding folder.
 - You can run these in the terminal or in an ipython notebook
 - You'll have to create your own test data sets and invoke the function, `solution(input)`
 - Some of the codes are derivative of existing examples and solutions in other languages
 - Most, if not all of the solutions scores a 100% on the evaluation results
 - Pls. inform me if any of the solutions score less than 100%
